# Calendar Integrations

We do integrate with external calendars in two specific moments:

1. When a user opens the public calendar and goes to the time selection, we check the connected calendars slots
2. When a user schedules a new meeting, we propagate the meeting to every configured calendar

As of today, we support 2 types of integrations:

- OAuth integrations: google and office365
- CalDav integrations: iCloud and Generic CalDav Providers
