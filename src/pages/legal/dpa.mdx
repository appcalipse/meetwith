**2\. Processing of Personal Data:**

  

1.  **Scope and Roles of the Parties**. The parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the processing of Customer Information, Meet With Wallet will act as processor to Customer, who may act as either a controller or a processor. Each party shall comply with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law, and this Addendum, when processing Customer Information. When Customer is acting as a controller, the Controller-to-Processor Clauses will apply to any Data Transfer that occurs pursuant to the Agreement. When Customer is acting as a processor, the Processor-to-Processor Clauses will apply to any Data Transfer that occurs pursuant to the Agreement. Customer agrees that it is unlikely that Meet With Wallet will know the identity of Customer’s controllers, if any, because Meet With Wallet has no direct relationship with Customer’s controllers. Therefore, Customer agrees that it will fulfill Meet With Wallet’s obligations to Customer’s controllers under the Processor-to-Processor Clauses. For the avoidance of doubt, this Addendum does not apply to Customer Usage Data or Customer Account Data. 

  

1.  **Customer Instructions**. Meet With Wallet shall process Customer Information only in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions as set forth in (i) the Agreement, including this Addendum and any applicable order forms; (ii) as necessary to comply with applicable law; (ii) or as otherwise agreed in writing or as initiated by Authorized Users in their use of the Services (including via configuration tools and APIs made available through the Services (“Permitted Purposes”). Customer may give additional instructions throughout the term of the Agreement. Meet With Wallet shall immediately inform Customer if it is unable to follow those instructions. 

  

1.  **Customer Obligations.** Customer represents and warrants that (i) it has complied, and will continue to comply, with all applicable laws, including Applicable Data Protection Law, in respect of its processing of Customer Information and any processing instructions it issues to Meet With Wallet; and (ii) it has, and will continue to have, the right to transfer, or provide access to, the personal data to Meet With Wallet for processing in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and this Addendum. Customer shall have the sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Information and the means by which Customer acquired Customer Information. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for complying with all laws (including Applicable Data Protection Law) applicable to any content created, sent, or managed through the Services. Customer specifically acknowledges and agrees that its use of the Services will not violate the rights of any data subject that has opted-out from the sale or other disclosure of his or her personal data. 

  

1.  Lawfulness of Instructions. Customer acknowledges that Meet With Wallet is neither responsible for determining which laws or regulations are applicable to Customer’s business nor whether Meet With Wallet’s provision of the Services meets or will meet the requirements of such laws or regulations. Customer will ensure that its instructions comply with Applicable Data Protection Law and Meet With Wallet’s processing of the Customer Information in accordance with Customer’s instructions will not cause Meet With Wallet to violate any applicable law, regulation, or rule, including without limitation Applicable Data Protection Law. Meet With Wallet will inform Customer if it becomes aware or reasonably believes that Customer’s data processing instructions violate Applicable Data Protection Law.

  

1.  **Meet With Wallet Personnel.** Meet With Wallet shall grant access to Customer Information to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management, and monitoring of the agreement. It will further ensure that any person it authorizes to process the Customer Information shall be under an appropriate obligation of conﬁdentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty).

  

1.  **Accuracy.** Customer agrees that it is unlikely that Meet With Wallet would become aware that Customer Information it has received is inaccurate or outdated. Nonetheless, if Meet With Wallet does become aware that Customer Information it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform Customer without undue delay and shall cooperate with Customer to erase or rectify the data. 

  

1.  **Return or Deletion of Customer Information.** Meet With Wallet shall only process Customer Information for the duration specified in Appendix 1.B. Upon Customer's request or upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Meet With Wallet agrees, at Customer’s option, exercised by delivery to Meet With Wallet in writing of its instruction, to either deliver to Customer or destroy in a manner that prevents Customer Information from being reconstructed any Customer Information and any copies thereof in Meet With Wallet's control or possession, except that this requirement shall not apply to the extent Meet With Wallet is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Information or to Customer Information it has archived on back-up systems, which Customer Information Meet With Wallet shall securely isolate, protect from any further processing, and eventually delete in accordance with Meet With Wallet’s deletion policies, except to the extent required by applicable law.

  

1.  **No Sale of Information.** Meet With Wallet will not sell Customer Information, nor retain, use, or disclose Customer Information for any commercial purpose other than providing the Services. Meet With Wallet will not disclose Customer Information outside the scope of the Agreement. Meet With Wallet understands its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law and will comply with them.

  

**3\. Responding to Data Subjects and Other Requests:** 

  

1.  **Assistance Provided to Customer.** Meet With Wallet provides Customer with several self-help features and tools within the Services. Customer may use these self-help features and tools to honor requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Law. To the extent Customer, in its ordinary use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a data subject request to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Law, Meet With Wallet shall, upon Customer’s written request, provide commercially reasonable assistance to Customer in responding to such data subject request. If complying with Customer’s request for assistance will require Meet With Wallet to expend significant resources, such assistance shall be at Customer’s expense (scoped in advance). 

  

1.  **Handling Requests Made Directly to Meet With Wallet**. In the event that any request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint from a data subject, regulator, or third party, including, but not limited to law enforcement, is made directly to Meet With Wallet in connection with Meet With Wallet’s processing of Customer Information, Meet With Wallet shall promptly inform Customer providing details of the same, to the extent legally permitted. Unless legally obligated to do so, Meet With Wallet shall not respond to any such request, inquiry, or complaint without Customer’s prior written consent. In the case of a legal demand for disclosure of Customer Information in the form of a subpoena, search warrant, court order or other compulsory disclosure request, Meet With Wallet shall attempt to redirect the requesting party or agency to request disclosure from Customer. Customer agrees that Meet With Wallet may provide Customer’s basic contact information for this purpose. If Meet With Wallet is unable to redirect the requesting party or agency, Meet With Wallet shall act in accordance with its obligations under the 2010 SCCs or 2021 SCCs, as applicable, incorporated herein. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Agreement, including this Addendum shall restrict or prevent Meet With Wallet from responding to any data subject or other requests in relation to personal data for which Meet With Wallet is a controller.

  

1.  **Data Protection Impact Assessments.** If Meet With Wallet believes or becomes aware that its processing of Customer personal data is likely to result in a high risk to the data protection rights and freedoms of data subjects, Meet With Wallet shall inform Customer and (taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Meet With Wallet) provide commercially reasonable cooperation to Customer in connection with any data protection impact assessment or consultations with Data Protection Supervisory Authorities that may be required under Applicable Data Protection Law. Meet With Wallet shall comply with the foregoing by: (i) complying with **Section 4.7 (Audits);** (ii) providing the information contained in the Agreement, including this Addendum; and (iii) if the foregoing sub-sections (i) and (ii) are insuﬃcient for Customer to comply with such obligations, upon request, providing additional reasonable assistance at Customer’s expense (scoped in advance).

  

**4\. Security:**

  

1.  **Technical and Organizational Measures**. Meet With Wallet has implemented and will maintain appropriate  technical  and  organizational  security  measures designed  to  preserve  the  security  and conﬁdentiality of Customer Information in accordance with Meet With Wallet’s security standards described in Appendix 2 (“Security Measures”).

  

1.  **Updates to Security Measures**. Customer is responsible for reviewing the information Meet With Wallet makes available regarding its data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer’s requirements and legal obligations, including its legal obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Meet With Wallet may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modiﬁcations do not materially decrease the overall security of the Services provided to Customer.

  

1.  **Security Incident Response**. Meet With Wallet shall, to the extent permitted by law, notify Customer without undue delay of any reasonably suspected or actual Security Incident which aﬀects Customer Information. Such notification will be delivered to one or more of Customer’s business or administrative contacts by any means Meet With Wallet selects, including via email. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information in the Services and under the Agreement at all times. The notice shall summarize in reasonable detail the nature and scope of the Security Incident, to the extent known, and the corrective action already taken or to be taken by Meet With Wallet. Furthermore, Meet With Wallet shall provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as reasonably requested by Customer and shall promptly take reasonable steps to remedy or mitigate the eﬀect of any Security Incident. Meet With Wallet’s notiﬁcation of or response to a Security Incident shall not be construed as an acknowledgement by Meet With Wallet of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident. The parties will collaborate on whether any notice of breach is required to be given to any person, and if so, the content of that notice. Unless prohibited by an applicable statute or court order, Meet With Wallet shall also notify Customer of any third-party legal process relating to any Security Incident, including, but not limited to, any legal process initiated by any governmental entity. 

  

1.  **Unsuccessful Security Incidents.** Customer agrees that an unsuccessful Security Incident will not be subject to **Section 4.3 (Security Incident Response).** An unsuccessful Security Incident is one that results in no unauthorized access to Customer Information or to any of Meet With Wallet’s equipment or facilities used to store or process Customer Information and could include, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls, port scans, unsuccessful log-in attempts or invalid URLs, denial of service attacks, packet sniffing (or other unauthorized access to traffic data that does not result in access beyond IP addresses or headers) or similar incidents. 

  

1.  **Customer Responsibilities.** Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that except as provided in this Addendum, Customer is responsible for its secure use of the Services, including securing its account authentication credentials, using the Services strictly as permitted under the Agreement, and using features and functionalities made available by Meet With Wallet to maintain appropriate security in light of the nature of the data processed. 

  

1.  **Documentation and Compliance.** The parties acknowledge that Customer must be able to assess Meet With Wallet’s compliance with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law and this Addendum. To facilitate such assessment, Meet With Wallet will keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of Customer under the Agreement, and upon written request, make available to Customer all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in this Addendum. 

  

1.  **Audits.** To the extent that Meet With Wallet is unable to demonstrate its compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law and this Addendum through appropriate documentation as described in **Section 4.6 (Documentation and Compliance)** above, then, upon Customer’s written request and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, Meet With Wallet shall allow for and contribute to audits and inspections conducted by Customer (or Customer’s independent, third-party auditor that is not a competitor of Meet With Wallet). Audits shall occur at most annually or more frequently (i) in response to a demand from a Data Protection Supervisory Authority, (ii) following notice of a Security Incident, or (iii) as a follow-up to a duly conducted annual audit. Audits must be preceded by thirty (30) days advance written notice, must be conducted during Meet With Wallet’s normal business hours, and must be limited to systems and procedures within Meet With Wallet’s control and relevant to Meet With Wallet’s processing of Customer Information. Meet With Wallet will make its personnel, records, and similar items available upon fewer than thirty (3) days advance notice, but no less than reasonable notice if (i) requested by a Data Protection Supervisory Authority pursuant to an audit or Customer or (ii) following notice of a Security Incident. In lieu of such an audit, in the event that Meet With Wallet independently obtains third-party annual audits of its privacy and security program, Customer agrees that Meet With Wallet may satisfy its obligations under this **Section 4.7 (Audits)**, by making available to Customer a copy of Meet With Wallet’s then most recent third-party audit report. Such audit reports will be made available to Customer upon Customer’s written requests, at reasonable intervals, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement. If any audit reveals any material vulnerability, Meet With Wallet shall take commercially reasonable steps to correct such vulnerability. 

  

**5\. Sub-processing:**

  

1.  **Authorized Sub-processors.** Meet With Wallet has Customer’s general authorization to engage third-party Sub-processors to fulfill its contractual obligations under this Addendum or to provide certain services on its behalf. The Sub-processors Meet With Wallet currently engages to carry out processing activities can be found here. At least ten (10) business days prior to engaging or removing any Sub- processor, Meet With Wallet will update this list and provide Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update. Customer may object to in writing to Meet With Wallet's appointment or replacement of a Sub-processor prior to its appointment or replacement, provided such objection is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such event, the parties shall discuss commercially reasonable alternative solutions in good faith. If the parties cannot reach resolution, Meet With Wallet will, in its sole discretion, either not appoint such Sub-processor, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the Agreement without liability to either party, in which case, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Addendum, the applicable SCCs or the Agreement, Meet With Wallet shall refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the Agreement from the date of suspension/termination of the Agreement as per the foregoing. 

  

1.  **Sub-processor obligations.** Meet With Wallet shall: (i) conduct appropriate due diligence on each Sub-processor it engages to perform services on its behalf; (ii) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Customer Information as those in this Addendum, to the extent applicable to the nature of the service provided by such Sub-processor; and (iii) remain responsible for such Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations of this Addendum and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-processor that cause Meet With Wallet to breach any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

**6\. International Data Transfers:**

  

1.  **Data Center Locations.** Customer understands and acknowledges that Customer Information may be transferred to and processed in the United States or in any country in which Meet With Wallet or its Sub-processors have operations. Meet With Wallet shall notify Customer at least ten (10) business days prior to adding or replacing a Sub-processor in the same manner provided for notification under **Section 5.1 (Authorized Sub-processors)** above. Customer may object in writing to Meet With Wallet’s changes as per the above, provided such objection is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection (including, but not limited to, changes of location for processing (including access) from within Europe to the United States or another non-Europe country). In such event, the parties shall discuss commercially reasonable alternative solutions in good faith. If the parties cannot reach resolution, Meet With Wallet will, in its sole discretion, either not proceed with the change, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the Agreement without liability to either party in which case, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Addendum, the applicable SCCs, or the Agreement, Meet With Wallet shall refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the Agreement from the date of suspension/termination of the Agreement as per the foregoing. Meet With Wallet shall ensure that such transfers comply with the requirements of Applicable Data Protection Law. 

  

1.  **European Data Transfers.** To the extent that Meet With Wallet receives Customer Information protected by European Data Protection Laws, Meet With Wallet agrees to abide by and process such data in compliance with the 2010 or 2021 SCCs, as applicable, which are incorporated herein in full and form an integral part of this Addendum. For the purposes of such SCCs: (i) Meet With Wallet is the “data importer” and Customer is the “data exporter” (notwithstanding that Customer may be an entity located outside of Europe); (ii) Appendixes 1 and 2 of this Addendum shall replace Appendixes 1 and 2 (or Annexes I and II to the Appendix, as applicable) and (iii) if the 2021SCCs apply, then they shall be applied giving effect to the Elections.

1.  **Liability Cap.** Each party and all of its Aﬃliates’ liability to the other party and its Affiliates, taken together arising out of or related this this Addendum, including the 2010 or 2021 SCCs, as applicable, shall be subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability set forth in the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Meet With Wallet and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from Customer arising out of or relating to the Agreement or this Addendum shall apply in aggregate. 

  

1.  **Liability to Data Subjects.** Nothing in **Section 7.1 (Liability Cap)** shall alter the parties’ liability to data subjects as provided for in either the 2010 or 2021 SCCs (as applicable). Each party agrees that it will be liable to data subjects for the entire damage resulting from a violation by it of Applicable Data Protection Law. If one party paid full compensation for the damage suﬀered, it is entitled to claim back from the other party that part of the compensation corresponding to the other party’s part of the responsibility for the damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to processing of personal data subject to either the 2010 or 2021 SCCs as provided herein, the allocation of liability to data subjects as between the parties shall be governed by the applicable SCCs taking into consideration that both parties agree that Customer will be liable to data subjects for the entire damage resulting from a violation of European Data Protection Law with regard to processing of personal data for which it is a controller, and that Meet With Wallet will only be liable to data subjects for the damage resulting from a violation of the obligations of European Data Protection Law directed to processor where it has acted outside of or contrary to Customer’s lawful instructions or violated this Addendum. Meet With Wallet will be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

  

**8\. Modiﬁcation and Termination of this Addendum:** This Addendum shall remain in eﬀect until the later of (i) termination of the Agreement or (ii) such time as Meet With Wallet no longer processes any Customer Information on behalf of Customer. Failure to comply with any of the material provisions of this Addendum is considered a material breach of the Agreement. In the event of termination, Meet With Wallet will return or destroy data pursuant to **Section 2.7 (Return or Deletion of Customer Information).** Meet With Wallet may update the terms of this Addendum from time to time; provided, however, Meet With Wallet will provide at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Customer of any proposed update. In the event that a competent Data Protection Supervisory Authority for the UK issues alternative SCCs for Data Transfers, (i) Meet With Wallet may, upon giving notice in accordance with this **Section 8 (Modification and Termination of this Addendum)** amend this Addendum to replace the 2010 SCCs referred to herein with such alternative SCCs and any such amendments or supplemental provisions as deemed necessary by Meet With Wallet for the purposes of this Addendum and (ii) from the date of such notice, any reference in this Addendum to the 2010 SCCs shall be deemed to refer to such alternative SCCs. The then-current terms of this Addendum are available at \[URL\]. 

  

**9\. Entire Agreement; Conﬂict:** This Addendum supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous agreements, oral and written, with regard to the subject matter of this Addendum, including any prior data processing addenda entered into between Customer and Meet With Wallet. If there is any conﬂict between this Addendum and any agreement, including the Agreement, the provisions of the following documents (in order of precedence) shall prevail: (a) the 2010 or 2021 SCCs (as applicable) and their Annexes; then (b) this Addendum and its Appendices; then (c) the Agreement.

  

**10.** **Invalidity and Severability:** 

  

**10.1** **General.** If any provision of this Addendum is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not aﬀect any other provision of this Addendum and all provisions not aﬀected by such invalidity or unenforceability will remain in full force and eﬀect.

  

**10.2 Invalidity of SCCs**. If the SCCs cease to or do not (including due to insufficient supplementary measures) meet the requirements under European Data Protection Law or otherwise cease to or do not provide a valid legal basis to transfer personal data outside the EEA, EU, UK, or Switzerland, Meet With Wallet shall (i) promptly notify Customer using the email address on file; (ii) upon request (whether or not Meet With Wallet has provided notice to Customer) immediately stop and, as applicable procedure the cessation of the processing by its Sub-processors of the affected personal data promptly after the occurrence of any such notifiable event outside the relevant countries (except to the extent directed otherwise by Customer), and as soon as possible put in place commercially reasonable measures to mitigate the impact of such; and (iii) discuss with Customer commercially reasonable alternative measures in order to ensure an adequate level of protection with respect to the privacy rights of individuals and the lawful transfer of, or access to, personal data outside the relevant countries whilst continuing the provision of the Services with minimum disruption to Customer. If the parties cannot reach resolution, Customer may suspend or terminate the Agreement without liability to either party, in which case, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Addendum or the Agreement, Meet With Wallet shall refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the Agreement from the date of suspension/termination of the Agreement as per the foregoing.
