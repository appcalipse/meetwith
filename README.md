# Meet With Wallet

Meet with Wallet provides an easy way to share your (or your DAO's) calendar and schedule meetings without any hassle or back-and-forth communication. All possible by simply connecting your crypto wallet. No registration needed, no more emails (only if you want to) - Own your private data! You know Calendly right? Same thing here, but for web3!

## Basic Setup

First of all, you'll need `node`installed in your environment, and you'll also need [doppler cli](https://docs.doppler.com/docs) with propper access given by one of our team members.

Given that you have the requirements ready, to run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
